The purpose of this code was to build a hashing algorithm
suitable for use in a Bloom Filter. The hashing algorithm 
implemented here is a mix of a murmur hash and an ARX hash.
The sample input file "100words.txt" is included and contains
a list of 100 words to be given has values. 

This code was written for a school assignment in my CS II class
at UCF.
